## Wishlist - JQuery

A short mini-project for myself to learn basic JQuery.

### Instructions

  Enter items you would like into the text-box and click 'Add to list'. When an item has been procured, click the red pending label on the right of the item. There is a total underneath the list showing how many items are pending and how many have been purchased.
